This is a sample theme for [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) based on [Keycloakify](https://www.keycloakify.dev/). The purpose of the theme is to show the possibility of creating a theme with react, MUI and vite.

Feel free to use the theme for your own projects or maybe add more features to it.
